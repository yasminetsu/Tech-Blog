# Tech-Blog

An application that allows the user have an account where they are able to post blogs. The user must create an account and log in to post, update, or delete blogs, however, the homepage with rendered blog posts is open to the public.


## Motivation

There is no question that having the opportunity to view other's thoughts and ideas about tech/programming is super valuable when engaging in this field. With a tech blog, users are able to look at what other techies are up to and also engage with them through commenting on their blog. This is a great way to network and learn at the same time. It is also helpful to write out your own ideas when learning to program. This is a great space to get those ideas out there and retain all the information that is gained.
